  													I became interested in fitness at an early age through my father who was a PT in the Army and also a Karate instructor. I started Karate at the age of 5 and I also became an accomplisted Thai boxer, winning a number of Scottish titles. After I had finished competing, I enjoyed being an instructor in Mixed Martial Arts. I also enjoy downhill mountain biking, surfing, and wake boarding.</p> 
  													<p>I have worked in the fitness industry for 22 years, and at Western for over 16 years as a fitness instructor/personal trainer and gym manager. On a day-to-day basis, I look after the gym, deal with membership enquiries, deliver inductions, and design programmes for members. I also tend to be the Mr Fix-it around the place!</p>

  													<p>I offer one to one personal training, specialising in: 
  														<ul>
  															<li>General fitness and sport specific training (with a special interest in tennis)</li>

  													<p><b>Education: B.Sc in Exercise and Health</b> <br />
  														<b>Industry Based Qualification: Reps Level 4 Instructor</b>
  													</p>

  													<p>I have worked and studied in the fitness industry for 15 years, covering a wide range of roles (Personal Trainer, Gym Manager, Cardiac Rehabilitation Instructor &amp; Master Trainer). This experience led met to develop The Get Results Customised Fitness Program.</p>

  													<p>Through our programs we aim to empower and educate our members to lead a healthier well balanced lifestyle. I am very passionate about supporting others to improve their health and well being as I believe optimal health is the number one most important thing in life. Without it we cannot enjoy our families, careers or wealth. I genuinely want to change the experience many people have had with dieting and exercising. Many people start out on diets or join fitness clubs only to receive very poor advice and service causing them to get little to no results or only achieve short term success. We aim to address this issue by committing fully to each and every one of our member’s needs and ensuring we do everything we possibly can to help them achieve their optimal health and body shape.</p>

  													<p>Education within the fitness industry is also central to my philosophy: only by ensuring a high caliber of fitness professionals working in Scotland can we improve the fitness and attitudes towards health of people living in Scotland I am the master trainer for Anytime Leisure and Quantum HFE Training delivering a wide range of courses (kettle bell, weight management, functional fitness workshops etc)</p>

  													<p>My fitness background comes from playing football, then venturing into Olympic triathlon distance races and marathons.  I now like to take a holistic approach to fitness aiming to be efficient in movement and thriving in health.</p>

  														<p>As a busy mum of 2, I know how difficult it can be fitting exercise into the daily routine. I&#39;ve always had an interest in all things health and fitness, and in 2013 decided to embark on a career change, leaving the office environment behind in pursuit of a more fulfilling career in Personal Training!</p>

  														<p>My passion for the last 15 years has been running, mostly 5 &amp; 10Ks, and earlier in 2014 achieving my goal of a half marathon. I strongly believe that exercise and nutrition go hand in hand on the road to achieving optimal health and well being, so for me, it&#39;s not a chore, simply a way of life.</p>

  														<p>If you&#39;re motivated to make some changes in your life, then I&#39;m motivated to help you. Whether your goal is to lose weight, run faster, become stronger, improve overall fitness levels or simply have a healthier lifestyle, at Get Results Fitness we&#39;ll design a program specifically for you, which supports your short and long term goals, and provide you with all the advice and nutritional guidance required to get you where you want to be. Since working with Get Results fitness I have had a great success rate with my clients and I believe this is because I genuinely care about each client I work with.</p>
